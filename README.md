This is from my work on 'Cosmic Phase Transitions as a Source of Gravitational Waves'.

My code(s) can take in the parameters of the Theory of a given field undergoing a first-order phase transition, and return the parameters conventionally used to find the gravitational wave power spectra.

To do this, the Bubble (or Bounce) approximation was used i.e. the Stationary Phase approximation was applied to the Path Integral of the field tunneling from False to True Vacuum, and the thusly found **Instanton Solution** was used.

A preliminary analysis of a typical 2-3-4 Potential was performed, using the WKB Approximation; this was primarily to build intuition and familiarize oneself with different aspects of the problem at hand.
